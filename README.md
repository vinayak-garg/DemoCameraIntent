#Demo Camera Intent

The Issue-

I am making an Android app for android OS 4.4 onwards. I am facing an issue specific to LG G3.
If I launch camera for capturing video through intent, the default camera app launches alright.
But the resolution setting of video is always set to VGA.

Steps to reproduce

1. Launch camera app by clicking on the button above
2. See that the camera resolution is set to VGA
3. Now exit the camera, and this app
4. Open phone's default camera app
5. Change the camera resolution to say 1080p
6. Now go back in our app
7. Repeat steps 1 and 2
